    "Concept:\n",
    "\n",
    "Contrary to its name, Logistic Regression is used for binary classification tasks. It models the probability that a given input point belongs to a certain class. \n",
    "\n",
    "The output is transformed using the logistic function (sigmoid), which maps any input to a value between 0 and 1. This probability can then be thresholded to make binary decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Points:\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression is a linear model for classification.\n",
    "It estimates the probability of an instance belonging to the positive class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The logistic function (sigmoid) maps linear combinations of features to probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    " Implementation Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Collection: Gather a labeled dataset with features and binary target values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Preprocessing: Clean, preprocess, and scale the features if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Splitting: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Selection: Choose Logistic Regression as the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Training: Fit the model to the training data, estimating the coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Evaluation: Use the testing data to evaluate the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thresholding: Choose a threshold for converting probabilities to binary predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualization: Plot decision boundaries and probability curves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Predictions: Make predictions on new data.\n",
