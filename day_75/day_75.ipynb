    "<!-- Handling categorical variables -->\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling categorical variables is a critical step in data preprocessing for machine learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "Categorical variables are those that represent categories or labels and are not inherently numeric. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are several common techniques for handling categorical variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. One-Hot Encoding (Dummy Variables):\n",
    "\n",
    "One-hot encoding is the most common method for dealing with categorical variables, especially when there is no ordinal relationship between categories.\n",
    "\n",
    " It creates binary columns for each category and assigns a 1 or 0 to indicate the presence or absence of a category.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Original \"Color\" column: [\"Red\", \"Green\", \"Blue\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "After one-hot encoding: \"Is_Red\" [1, 0, 0], \"Is_Green\" [0, 1, 0], \"Is_Blue\" [0, 0, 1]\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "\n",
    "Maintains the non-ordinal nature of categorical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compatible with most machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Increases the dimensionality of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Label Encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "Label encoding assigns a unique integer label to each category. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's suitable when there is an inherent ordinal relationship among categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Original \"Size\" column: [\"Small\", \"Medium\", \"Large\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "After label encoding: [0, 1, 2]\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple and efficient for ordinal data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Can introduce unintended ordinal relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "May not be suitable for non-ordinal data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Ordinal Encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal encoding is a variation of label encoding specifically designed for ordinal categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    " It assigns labels to categories based on their natural order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Original \"Education\" column: [\"High School\", \"Bachelor's\", \"Master's\", \"Ph.D.\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "After ordinal encoding: [0, 1, 2, 3]\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "\n",
    "Preserves the ordinal relationship in ordinal data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Inappropriate for nominal data.\n",
    "\n"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "4. Binary Encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary encoding combines aspects of both one-hot encoding and label encoding. \n",
    "\n",
    "It converts each category into binary code and then encodes it as integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Original \"Day of the Week\" column: [\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\", \"Thursday\", \"Friday\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "After binary encoding: [0, 1, 10, 11, 100]\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "\n",
    "Reduces dimensionality compared to one-hot encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "\n",
    "May not be as interpretable as one-hot encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Frequency Encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "Frequency encoding replaces categories with their frequencies (the number of times each category appears in the dataset).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Original \"City\" column: [\"New York\", \"San Francisco\", \"New York\", \"Los Angeles\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "After frequency encoding: [\"New York\": 2, \"San Francisco\": 1, \"Los Angeles\": 1]\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "\n",
    "Can capture the importance of categories based on their frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "\n",
    "May not be suitable for high-cardinality categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing the right encoding method depends on the nature of your categorical data and the specific requirements of your machine learning algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's essential to understand your data and make informed decisions to preprocess categorical variables effectively."
