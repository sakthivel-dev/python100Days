    "Flask is a micro web framework for Python that is designed to be lightweight, simple, and flexible. It's used to build web applications quickly and easily by providing the essential components needed for web development. Flask is not a full-stack framework like Django; instead, it focuses on the core functionality needed to handle HTTP requests, route them to appropriate functions, and generate HTTP responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key features and concepts of Flask:\n",
    "\n",
    "Routing: Flask allows you to define routes that associate URLs with functions. When a user accesses a specific URL, Flask routes    the request to the appropriate Python function, which generates an HTTP response.\n",
    "\n",
    "Templates: Flask uses a template engine, typically Jinja2, to generate dynamic HTML content. Templates enable you to embed Python code within HTML, making it easy to create dynamic web pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "View Functions: These are Python functions that are associated with specific routes. They handle incoming requests, process data, and generate responses (HTML, JSON, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Request and Response Objects: Flask provides request and response objects to handle incoming HTTP requests and generate appropriate responses. These objects contain useful data and methods for handling client interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "URL Building: Flask includes functions for building URLs dynamically, which is particularly helpful for creating links between different parts of your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extensions: Flask has a vibrant ecosystem of extensions that provide additional features, such as database integration, authentication, form handling, and more. These extensions help you add functionality to your application without reinventing the wheel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Development Server: Flask comes with a built-in development server that makes it easy to test and debug your applications locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "RESTful APIs: Flask can be used to create RESTful APIs, making it suitable for building backend services for mobile apps, single-page applications, and other clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: While Flask itself is minimal, you can combine it with other libraries and tools to build more complex applications as needed.\n",
    "\n"
