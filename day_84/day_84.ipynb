    "# Introduction to Neural Networks and Neurons\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks, often referred to as artificial neural networks (ANNs), \n",
    "\n",
    "are a class of machine learning models inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. \n",
    "\n",
    "They are a fundamental part of deep learning, a subset of machine learning that deals with deep neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "consisting of multiple layers. Here's an overview of neural networks and their basic building blocks, neurons: \n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Neurons:\n",
    "\n",
    "A neuron, in the context of artificial neural networks, is a fundamental computational unit inspired by biological \n",
    "\n",
    "neurons in the human brain. Each artificial neuron performs a simple computation and is connected to other neurons\n",
    "\n",
    "to form complex networks. Key components of a neuron include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Inputs: Neurons receive input signals from other neurons or from external sources. \n",
    "\n",
    "    These inputs are weighted to reflect their importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Weights: Each input is associated with a weight, which determines the strength of the input's influence on the neuron's output. \n",
    "\n",
    "    These weights are learnable parameters that are adjusted during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Summation Function: Neurons compute a weighted sum of their inputs, which is often followed by the addition of a bias term. \n",
    "\n",
    "    The summation function is represented as ∑(input * weight) + bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Activation Function: The weighted sum is then passed through an activation function. \n",
    "\n",
    "    The activation function introduces non-linearity to the neuron's output. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Common activation functions include sigmoid, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), and tanh.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Output: The result of the activation function is the output of the neuron, \n",
    "\n",
    "    which may serve as input to other neurons in subsequent layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Neural Networks:\n",
    "\n",
    "A neural network is a collection of interconnected neurons organized into layers. \n",
    "\n",
    "    There are typically three types of layers in a neural network:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Input Layer: The input layer receives raw data and passes it to the hidden layers. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Each neuron in the input layer corresponds to a feature in the input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Hidden Layers: Hidden layers are intermediary layers between the input and output layers. \n",
    "\n",
    "    These layers perform computations and learn patterns from the input data through the weighted connections between neurons.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Output Layer: The output layer produces the final prediction or classification result. \n",
    "\n",
    "    The number of neurons in the output layer depends on the specific task—binary classification may have one neuron, \n",
    "    \n",
    "    while multi-class classification may have multiple neurons."

    "3. Feedforward and Backpropagation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Training a neural network involves a two-step process:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Feedforward: During this phase, data is passed through the network\n",
    "\n",
    "    from the input layer to the output layer, and predictions are made.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Backpropagation: In this phase, the network's performance is evaluated using a loss or error function, \n",
    "\n",
    "    which measures the difference between predicted and actual values. Errors are propagated backward through the network, and \n",
    "    \n",
    "    the weights and biases of the neurons are adjusted to minimize the error. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    This process is typically performed using optimization algorithms like gradient descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Deep Learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning extends the concept of neural networks to deep neural networks, which have multiple hidden layers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in various fields, including image recognition, natural language processing, and\n",
    "\n",
    "autonomous driving, due to its ability to model complex, hierarchical patterns in data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, neural networks and neurons are the fundamental building blocks of deep learning, \n",
    "\n",
    "allowing machines to learn complex patterns and make predictions from data. \n",
    "\n",
    "They have revolutionized various industries and are at the forefront of AI research and development."
