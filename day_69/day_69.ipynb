    "<!-- Linear Regression: Concept and implementation. -->\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Regression is a fundamental supervised machine learning algorithm used for predicting continuous values. \n",
    "\n",
    "It models the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features) by fitting a linear equation to the observed data points.\n",
    "\n",
    " The goal is to find the best-fitting line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) that minimizes the distance between the predicted values and the actual values.\n",
    "\n",
    " Key Assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    " There is a linear relationship between the features and the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "The residuals (differences between predicted and actual values) are normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The residuals have constant variance (homoscedasticity).\n",
    "\n",
    "The features are not strongly correlated with each other (no multicollinearity).\n",
    "\n",
    " Implementation Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Collection: Gather a dataset containing features and target values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing    values and outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Splitting: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Selection: Choose Linear Regression as the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Training: Fit the model to the training data, estimating the coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Evaluation: Use the testing data to evaluate the model's performance.\n",

    "Visualization: Plot the regression line and scatter plot of data points.\n",
