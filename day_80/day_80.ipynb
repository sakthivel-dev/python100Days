    "# Evaluation Metrics for Regression Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression models are used to predict continuous numerical values, such as house prices, stock prices, or temperature. \n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluating the performance of regression models involves measuring how well their predictions align with the actual target values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some commonly used evaluation metrics for regression models:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Mean Absolute Error (MAE):\n",
    "\n",
    "Formula: (1/n) * Σ |actual - predicted|\n",
    "\n",
    "Description: Measures the average absolute difference between actual and predicted values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation: The lower the MAE, the better the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Mean Squared Error (MSE):\n",
    "\n",
    "Formula: (1/n) * Σ (actual - predicted)^2\n",
    "\n",
    "Description: Measures the average squared difference between actual and predicted values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation: The lower the MSE, the better the model's performance. It penalizes large errors more heavily than MAE.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):\n",
    "\n",
    "Formula: √MSE\n",
    "\n",
    "Description: RMSE is the square root of MSE. It provides a measure of the error in the same units as the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation: Like MSE, lower RMSE values indicate better model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE):\n",
    "\n",
    "Formula: (1/n) * Σ |(actual - predicted) / actual| * 100\n",
    "\n",
    "Description: Measures the average percentage difference between actual and predicted values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation: It quantifies prediction errors as a percentage of the actual values, making it easy to understand in real-world terms.\n",
    "\n"

    "5. R-squared (R²) Score:\n",
    "\n",
    "Formula: 1 - (SSR / SST), where SSR is the sum of squared residuals and SST is the total sum of squares.\n",
    "\n",
    "Description: Measures the proportion of the variance in the target variable that is explained by the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "    R² ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating better fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation: R² = 1 means the model explains all variance, while R² = 0 means the model doesn't explain any variance beyond the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Adjusted R-squared:\n",
    "\n",
    "Formula: 1 - [(1 - R²) * (n - 1) / (n - p - 1)], where n is the number of data points and p is the number of predictors (features).\n",
    "\n",
    "Description: A modified version of R² that adjusts for the number of predictors. It penalizes model complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation: A higher adjusted R² suggests a better trade-off between model fit and complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Mean Bias Deviation (MBD):\n",
    "\n",
    "Formula: (1/n) * Σ (actual - predicted)\n",
    "\n",
    "Description: Measures the average bias or systematic error in predictions. Positive values indicate overestimation, while negative values indicate underestimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation: Ideally, MBD should be close to zero, indicating minimal bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Coefficient of Determination (COD):\n",
    "\n",
    "Formula: 1 - (Σ (actual - predicted)^2 / Σ (actual - mean(actual))^2)\n",
    "\n",
    "Description: Similar to R², COD measures the proportion of the variance in the target variable explained by the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation: COD values close to 1 indicate a good fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of evaluation metric(s) for regression models depends on the specific objectives of your modeling task and the nature of the target variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, MAE and RMSE are often used for their simplicity and interpretability, while R² and adjusted R² are useful for assessing how well the model explains variance in the data."
